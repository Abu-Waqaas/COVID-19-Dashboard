The data was in different sheet from the source, the Death case, Recovery case and confirmed case were in different sheet from the source.
SO, everything were merge in a single sheet called Consolidated sheet, and I also generated a new column of active case which was gotten with the formule; Confirmed case - (Death case + Recovery case)
